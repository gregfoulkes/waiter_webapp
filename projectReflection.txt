1. I have just completed the waiters webapp project.

2. I used my existing javascript, handlebars, html and database(postgres). I also used my existing knowledge of the express framework to set up and run my work on a local server. I deployed my app to heroku and tested on travis where I set up the necessary configurations in order to run and test my app with a database.

3.I have made use of persisiting data before but it has always been text for the most part. In this project I used checkboxes to select days for work and made them persisiting checkboxes to reflect the days a user had already selected. 

I found the semantic ui framework and found it to be probably the most useful of all the ui frameworks I have tried so far, at least for me. I learn't a lot about it in this project. 

The other thing Ithat was new to me in this project was having to use multiple tables in my database and join them or find the relationship between them. I expanded my knowledge of the database query language to include things like joins this time.

4.Using the semantic ui framework made it much easier for me to out together a quick interface for my app but I had a number of issues with it when trying to deploy my app to heroku and travis. This mainly had to do with it being installed as a dependency and some node packages it was trying to install when building on heroku, but I eventually figured it out and fixed the problem. 

I have rarely had to write more than a one line query from a database with no more than two tables up until now so having to write multible line query and join two tables to a third one is still something I find quite challenging.

5.I expanded my knowledge of the query language for postgres database and how to make use of multiple tables and joins etc. I used semantic-ui for the first time and learn't a bit about how to implement it to quickly put together an interface for my app. I leatn't to create persitent checkboxes.
